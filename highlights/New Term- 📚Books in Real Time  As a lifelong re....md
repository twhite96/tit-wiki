## Highlights
* As a lifelong reader, I spend a lot of time reflecting on how my reading habits change.
* Digital formats represent a massive shift in these habits.
* The internet brought us blogs, followed by microblogs and tweets. Thoughts became more punchy, fast. Individual items (posts, articles, thoughts, comments) contained fewer words, but the amount of items produced are multitudinous. Recently, we've seen the evolution of the written word shifting again with newsletters. A hybrid favoring long-form, but forgoing the lag of "professional" editorial.
* I suspect many of these newsletters would have in the past found themselves packed in magazines and journals, or bundled up and edited into books.
* newsletters provide a sense of gravitas not inherently found on a "blog" (that's a heavy, viscous word, rife with connotations), a speed of distribution matching micro formats, and a bundling of thoughts rivaling carefully curated bookshelves.
* It is a choice to crack the spine on a printed and bound volume, load an ebook, rustle a newspaper, or open an email. And these days, for me, I almost habitually read my email newsletters first, and only then move on to other formats if I have time left in my day.
