This movie was *terrible*.


> I was bored in the beginning, confused in the middle and gave up shortly after the scene with the fat man eating whatever the fuck that was covered in syrup with his bare paws. 

> The stereotypes are too stereotypical to be taken seriously but then again this whole movie is trying to be campy and self-aware and it fails spectacularly.
