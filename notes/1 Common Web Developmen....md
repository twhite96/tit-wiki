## Highlights
- 1/ Common web development terms in 280 characters.
  Let me know what terms you'd like me to explain and I'll add more to this thread over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1506287007307341834))
- 2/ Compilation
  You write code in developer-friendly languages (TypeScript, modern JavaScript, JSX).
  Then, compilation transforms it back to standard JavaScript so the browser can understand it.

- 3/ Minifying
  You write code optimized for human readability. But things like comments aren't necessary for the code to run.
  Minification removes unnecessary code formatting / comments, without changing the codeâ€™s functionality, to decrease the file size.

- 4/ Bundling
  You write code as modules and components, then import / export reusable pieces of code, creating a web of dependencies.
  Bundling resolves this web to combine files, reducing the number of network requests needed when visiting a page.

- 5/ Code Splitting
  You write code for many URLs in your application. However, you only want to load the code needed for that URL.
  Code splitting separates your application code into smaller chunks for each URL, improving initial load time by only loading the code for that page.

- 6/ Client-Side Rendering
  The browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server, along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. Then, the user's device creates the rendered UI using JavaScript.

- 7/ Prerendering
  The server generates HTML in advance, instead of having the rendered UI created by JavaScript on the user's device. 
  HTML provides a fast non-interactive page, and then hydration makes components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button).
