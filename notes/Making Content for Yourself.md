- Many of the people I follow seem to struggle with either wanting to write more and not having a subject, or pigeonhole themselves to a point they feel trapped. The truth is, I often start typing away intending to publish something without even a topic in mind. The tactile feedback from my keyboard is enough to keep my happy for a little while.
  I don’t have ‘a thing’. There isn’t one area that motivates me to write about it, there is just me. I think that is the reason that my posts meander around some topics, but rarely stay still. There’s some tech, some personal things, some really random posts, but mostly it is just what is going on in my head. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20r9t5xxy7fxk581rkcn62))

- A lesson to be learned here is just make something you want, fuck everyone else and worry about what ***you*** want to make. If someone else likes what you put out into the world, then that’s wonderful, but it isn’t the main goal. As the great Steven Pressfield says, “[w]e must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or attention or applause. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20s5wer159af6t8yhjb0jz))
- “make something for yourself, not for others.” They aren’t just saying this to gain points for being motivational; it is because literally no one but you will give a shit when you start, so you might as well make something that you can hang your hat on. Otherwise, you won’t have anyone admiring what you made. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20t2mffcfamrsz0g0g8gej))
- For instance, if you find yourself always talking about other people and what *they* might think of your work, you might want to ask yourself why *you* want to make something in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20vf5rb3pvqw29jzg1skxc))
- If you think that none of your ideas are good enough to be consumed, you can still make it and decide not to share it. Dan Harmon’s advice for writer’s block has been a huge help for me which is, “prove you are a bad writer. You are trying to prove you are a good writer; that is what’s blocking you.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20vvwjmxrxcctctcsfxkc3))
- In short, dig deeper into what is causing these negative feelings and thoughts toward your work, and see what might be causing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20w67tt8v2byc9aw7fpb48))
- Another quote I wanted to put in here from Pressfield was, “If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), ‘Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?’ chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx20wfedbtmjs814weq479xg))
