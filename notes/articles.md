# Article Notes

You and I read a lot or else we wouldn't be taking so many notes. I have a premium subscription to [Readwise](https://readwise.io) which grants me access to [Readwise Reader Beta](https://reader.readwise.io). I was using [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) but the Readwise client is *so robust*; pdfs, epubs, articles, tweets so much stuff.

Here you'll find some of my Readwise highlights on the articles I've read.

## [[Composing Software An Introduction]]

![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[Eric Elliott]]
- Full Title: Composing Software: An Introduction
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://medium.com/p/27b72500d6ea

## Highlights
- Likewise, every time you chain array method calls, lodash methods, observables (RxJS, etc‚Ä¶) you‚Äôre composing functions. If you‚Äôre chaining, you‚Äôre composing. If you‚Äôre passing return values into other functions, you‚Äôre composing. If you call two methods in a sequence, you‚Äôre composing using this as input data.
- The process of software development is breaking down large problems into smaller problems, building components that solve those smaller problems, then composing those components together to form a complete application.
- In 2013, a jury found Toyota‚Äôs software development team guilty of ‚Äúreckless disregard‚Äù after an accident investigation revealed spaghetti code with 10,000 global variables.

## [[How Node and Javascript Handle Asynchronous Functions]]

![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[Jason Arnold]]
- Full Title: How Node and Javascript Handle Asynchronous Functions
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://medium.com/p/7feb9fc8a610

## Highlights
- The execution order of asynchronous actions along side synchronous actions can seem like a bit of a mystery when you first start using Javascript. But the built in workflow and mechanisms of the call stack, event loop, and callback queue are there to handle these requests at appropriate times.
- This is why callback functions show up after all of the functions in the main part of the program. Because they have to go through the callback queue and only get put into the call stack by the event loop once the call stack is empty.
- This is what causes output from a callback function to appear after all of the other non-callback functions. The non-callback functions are like VIPs that don‚Äôt have to wait in line to get executed. Meanwhile, those callback functions are being held in a separate queue until it is their turn.
- As you can see, we still get the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô and ‚Äòlast‚Äô logged to the screen before the data from the Google API is returned. This is because when data is returned from the Axios call, it is in the form of a Promise and that Promise can have callback functions applied to it.
- You might think that the callback gets executed out of order due to the delay in setTimeout(). That‚Äô what I thought at first, but take a look at this example:
- Here, the console of ‚Äòsecond‚Äô happened after ‚Äòlast‚Äô. Why? Because that console.log() statement is in a callback function which gets executed out of order. And since Javascript is non-blocking it continues on executing more functions. In this case, the ‚Äòlast‚Äô console.log() gets executed and then finally the callback function is fired and ‚Äòsecond‚Äô is seen on the screen.
- In order to mimic something like an asynchronous call we can use the ‚ÄòsetTimeout‚Äô method. This takes two arguments; the first is a function which will be a callback function, and the second is the amount of time to delay calling that function in milliseconds.
- This necessity happens most often with programs that make requests over the network to retrieve data.
- A blocking function can be bad since everything in the program stops and waits for that function to finish before it can continue. They can also be necessary since sometimes you have to wait for one part of a program to finish before continuing on to the next...

## Highlights
- And like a carpenter, I really enjoy building things. Sometimes that means following a specific plan, and other times you just work with what you‚Äôve got.
- Like an artist I need to occasionally think outside the box, tap my creativity, and be able to see in abstracts. I want to embrace imperfection.
- Like a scientist I enjoy analyzing problems, trying different angles to solve them, and then sharing my findings. I want to understand how things work, and I want others to benefit from that understanding.

## [[Javascript Passing by Value vs. Reference Explained in Plain English]]

![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)

## Metadata
- Author: [[Chris D‚ÄôAscoli]]
- Full Title: Javascript Passing by Value vs. Reference Explained in Plain English
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://medium.com/p/8d00fd06a47c

## Highlights
- When we create variable (b) and assign it the value of (a) the equals operator notices we‚Äôre dealing with a primitive value (5 in this case) and creates a NEW location in memory, points (b) to the NEW address, and fills it with a copy of (a)‚Äôs value (5). The console.log() of each variable prints what we would expect (5) at this point. However, when we change the value of (a) to 1 and console.log both variables (a) prints 1 as expected, but (b) is still equal to 5. Why? Because as discussed earlier when we assigned (b) to equal (a) a new location in memory was created, the equals operator did not simply have (b) point to the same spot in memory that (a) does, (b) was given its own location filled with the value of (a) at that time (5). So when (a) was changed (b) does not follow suit because it‚Äôs pointing to it‚Äôs OWN spot in memory, it has no idea that (a)‚Äôs value has changed since that is an entirely separate address in memory.

## Highlights
- One side note, you can‚Äôt crowdsource writing a good movie script or writing good music. To the extent products rely on creative insight or inspiration (video game dev for example) you can‚Äôt focus group your way to success. Once the core product is created you can use user feedback. But too often focus groups happen too early in the product development process and dilute the direction and potential impact.

However, a growing number of so-called ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù are rejecting this move, even when their follower count indicates they could be earning enough off social media alone. Instead, they are opting to keep their day jobs, and, for some, it‚Äôs proving lucrative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphaxcky165v1vxsp6943vzn))

- Whenever I tell strangers about what I do for a living, I usually receive two types of responses.
  Some express jealousy that I get to be my own boss and engage in creatively rewarding work. Others declare they could never follow that career path because they simply don‚Äôt have the discipline to do so.
  Every day, I drag myself out of bed at 7 a.m. and tackle a long list of tasks. I do this regardless of whether I‚Äôm feeling inspired that day, and sometimes I work very long hours so I can meet my weekly production goals. This takes a tremendous amount of self-motivation and discipline, and that‚Äôs not something that everyone has...[...cont]

## [[An Interview With Replit Founder Amjad Masad]]

## Highlights
* I got into technology fairly early on, my father got a computer, although he was an engineer working for the government, not making a lot of money, he was really interested in computers. I think it was 1993, I was six years old and it‚Äôs one of my earliest memories, looking over my father‚Äôs shoulder and seeing him typing DOS commands, single-finger, typing the commands and I was able to really understand intuitively what computers were.
  * **Note**: I wonder how much more money his family had compared to his brethren in Jordan ü§î
* the precursor to Replit is an open source project that I wrote that was one of the first projects to make it possible to code in the browser. You could write some JavaScript in the browser, but you couldn‚Äôt run Python or say Java or Ruby or what have you, and so it was just a technical breakthrough and open source breakthrough. We were in Hacker News and a bunch of places, that was 2011, and that got me a job at Code Academy, because they used our open source software and Code Academy was in YC, I joined them first as an engineer, they got me an O-1 Visa and I came to the United States to work at a YC company.

    * Title: [[Farewell, OmniFocus, farewell!]]
* Author: [[Von Jan Schaller]]

## Highlights
* However, sometimes it feels like a company is moving in a direction you don‚Äôt want to follow anymore. I had this feeling first when OmniFocus introduced its built-in automation engine. Yes, it is an incredible achievement from a technical standpoint. However ‚Äì how many users need this on even a semiregular basis? It seems to me that this is only used by such a tiny fraction of the user base that it feels more like being developed for themselves and probably a handful of extreme automation power users. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, no offense against extreme automation power users. I just think that they have left an approach which is useful to most of their users. I am not certain if this is something that serves them well in the future.
