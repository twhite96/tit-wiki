## Highlights
- Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no libertarians in a bank run. We now see appeals for more government intervention using taxpayers funds:
- The idea is to avoid a free-fall into an epidemic of insolvency. This worked during the 2007–2008 crisis when, incidentally, the federal government injected $235M into SVB under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Fifteen years later, billions might be required to forestall further contamination of our treasured “free market” systems.
