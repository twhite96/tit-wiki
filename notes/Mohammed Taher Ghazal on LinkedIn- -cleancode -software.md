## Highlights
* Avoid writing comments as if they were the plague!! And maybe even more than that! Why all that you ask?? Aren't comments used to clarify our code & make complicated things clearer? Yes, they surely are. But many many times, comments cause more harm than good.
* Comments are NEVER a replacement for clean & readable code. I actually feel like writing this line 3 more times due to how important it is... ðŸ˜… If you write a mess of a code, then writing a comment that explains what this mess does is not the good solution, it's the lazy one.
  * **Note**: Explaining what the code does !== a bad design decision; itâ€™s bad commenting etiquette which can be fixed if a proper set of rules are created in a design doc on HOW to write effective comments
