# Apple Punditry Has a Diversity Problem

- All white dudes
- Wanting a seat at the table but feeling like I won't get my voice heard
- Case in point: most prominent Apple pundits don't know who Ish Shabazz is even though he was in an Apple approved movie
- I try to make conversation in certain prominent Apple spaces but feel drowned out by people who already know each other
	- What can I do better?
		- I need to be more consistent in those spaces and open myself up to those taking up space
		- Keep going
- Why are PoC not being seen in this space?
	- I've thought about this a lot these past couple of days and I always, have always felt like an anomaly; a black girl who was tech inclined (especially in the 90s) became a woman who's also tech inclined. Family had money, was educated, and even though mom and I were lower middle class and I was super poor as an adult, I had things and family to fall back on. 
	- I have engineers, social workers, state employees, and medical staff in my family, so it was no issue for me and my cousins to get the tech we wanted. Not all PoC have this, and not just the money but the exposure and opportunity, and the opportunity to get an education. A lot of PoC are at a disadvantage because of this. 
	- To be an "Apple Pundit", you have to have to have some level of disposable income which eliminates a lot of folks, black, white, brown, whatever. But PoC are statistically behind when it comes to wealth accumulation and knowing _how_ to acquire wealth _the right way_. A lot of us aren't taught financial literacy but I think I am getting ahead of myself here. Bring it in.
	- When you don't have money and you only see white kids with iPhones and a commercial that says: If you don't have an iPhone, well, you don't have an iPhone.
	- That ad made me so mad, mad enough that I absolutely _despised_ Apple yet coveted the Apple cachet.
