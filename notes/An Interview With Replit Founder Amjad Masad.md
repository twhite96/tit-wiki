## Highlights
* I got into technology fairly early on, my father got a computer, although he was an engineer working for the government, not making a lot of money, he was really interested in computers. I think it was 1993, I was six years old and it’s one of my earliest memories, looking over my father’s shoulder and seeing him typing DOS commands, single-finger, typing the commands and I was able to really understand intuitively what computers were.
  * **Note**: I wonder how much more money his family had compared to his brethren in Jordan 🤔
* the precursor to Replit is an open source project that I wrote that was one of the first projects to make it possible to code in the browser. You could write some JavaScript in the browser, but you couldn’t run Python or say Java or Ruby or what have you, and so it was just a technical breakthrough and open source breakthrough. We were in Hacker News and a bunch of places, that was 2011, and that got me a job at Code Academy, because they used our open source software and Code Academy was in YC, I joined them first as an engineer, they got me an O-1 Visa and I came to the United States to work at a YC company.
  * **Note**: Some luck here buoyed by talent.
* AM: Yes. Well, and then the part of it is also having enough personal runway to be able to just bootstrap the company a little bit before being able to raise capital. We weren’t able to actually get into YC, we applied three, four times. We got into YC also in a non-traditional way. Paul Graham saw us on Hacker News and they invited us to YC, that was two years after we started the company. Actually it was really hard to raise money for the company in the first two years. Bloomberg Beta took a bet on us, they were the first check, $600,000, and that kept us afloat for two years. We were like three, four people the entire time, we were growing, we had a lot of users, but we weren’t able to hire a lot of people. So we were bootstrap-ish until we got into YC.
  * **Note**: I see a theme here so when he shouts about pulling himself up from his bootstraps being a poor boy from Jordan, remember this.
* That was a semi-success, it kind of works, some companies still try to do that today. But really, the ambition behind it immediately grew which is “Okay, you can do homework here now, but what else can you do?” Then our users started asking for more. “Hey, can I write a web server here? Hey, can I use it for my startup? Hey, can I interview someone on here?” So all these use cases started opening up and so the ambition became, “Okay, we need to build a full development experience”. So you should be able to open a browser tab and build Facebook, you should be able to build a billion, trillion dollar company from your browser, and that is Replit. That’s what’s we’ve been really heads down executing on for many, many years is that, “Open a new browser tab, start a company, start a product, start Bitcoin, start whatever software you can imagine”.
  * **Note**: Bruh. That's not how this shit works.
* That was the fundamental insight that I had even before I came here, because I had started making money and I had started companies and all these things happened just because my father happened to be interested in computers in 1993. So I thought, “Okay, what are the implications of that? What world is that going to create?”
  * **Note**: A moment of self-awareness here
* Across my career you see this thread, and obviously I wasn’t planning this out, which is why I love Steve Jobs’ connecting things backwards speech. That’s the generator function that’s been generating a lot of ideas for me across my career, across my investments as well.
  * **Note**: Big tech bro jargon 'generator function' huh.
* Internet are the great equalizers, and that developers or programming is this new magical skill that anyone can learn and anyone can leverage to change their lives in a fundamental way.
  * **Note**: This is so naïve but I get it, as a morally bankrupt, recovering capitalist
* You have this concept where you create a Replit, you click one button, you can be in an environment. That environment is you can write code, you can see the output of the code, you can sort of work in it, and then you can click a button and run it. You can share a link, other people can get access to it. Then you talked about, “Well, someone should be able to build Facebook in Replit,” right? There’s a big gap there, but this idea of it all being integrated together — what I see and view and hear from you is being integrated together isn’t just the initial user experience of writing code but also all the way to hosting and distributing and all those sorts of things. Is that how it’s always going to be? There’s some aspect where the ambitions are very broad and you want to compete all the way up and down this stack. Is this always going to be a self-contained bit where if you start on Replit, you’re going to be on Replit forever, or do you see in the long run this being an on-ramp to other services that are more standalone? AM: Yeah, that’s a good question. We are not sitting in a room somewhere planning to create this massive lock-in for our users where you can never leave or whatever. Actually we’ve been fairly open. We designed a platform in a way that the places where it’s obvious that you’re integrating deeply into Replit, it’s obvious you can always download your code and you can always run it wherever you want. But the reality of the situation is that there’s so much pain in trying to set up a development environment and deploy your code and doing all that software development cycle that if we just vertically integrated, we’d actually get a lot of benefits. Some of the benefits including access to every open source package in the world, built around this open source operating system called Nix. Actually Nix is not really an operating system, it’s an operating system generator. So it’s a functional programming language that generates an operating system based on inputs and those inputs are packages. All of this to say is that you have access to every open source package in the world at your fingertips, and we actually detect what your intent is, so if you import Flask, we sort of figure out that you’re trying to do a web server, we install that package for you, we run that code for you. You go to the shell, you try to run say htop or whatever, shell utility, we’ll also go install that package for you and instantly you have it around. So we’re able to create a really superior experience across the stack because we’re vertically integrated, and we can do all these things.
  * **Note**: But Docker exists. GitPod exists. VS Code in the browser exists. StackBlitz exists.
* I really want to understand more about who your users are. One thing you read a lot about is Replit has a massively positive reputation, I would say, amongst teachers for example, where it’s just so much easier for students in a class. I think this really came to the fore during COVID when people were working from home, and you couldn’t help students get their computers set up correctly and the ability to just go to a browser and to your point, everything is there ready to use. There’s another core which is people like young Amjad back in Amman who doesn’t have access to a ton of resources but does have a computer with a browser, and Replit is accessible and it’s free to use. But then if you go to the other end of the spectrum, there are professional developers who would perhaps argue that making it hard to get set up is an excellent filter for people who are good at problem solving, Replit maybe makes it too easy. I would assume your biggest market is by far on that first side of the spectrum, the people that where the ease of use is a really killer feature. The problem is maybe all the money to be made or the big market at least today is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Do you see Replit in the long run bridging that gap? Or is this a situation where you’re going to be so easy to use and so easy to get started and then you’ll just keep building features over time that you’ll capture the next generation and you don’t need to worry about the gray beards over there saying like, “Oh, that’s trivial. I could have built that if I wanted to.” AM: I think the answer is both, and historically it’s been both. So if you look at the PC revolution, the microcomputer, it started with kids and with hobbyists and computer clubs. What did the professionals do? They were using IBM mainframes at their companies and they looked down at everyone that used a PC. PCs didn’t have a killer app, it was VisiCalc or some of the spreadsheet apps that were the first killer apps.
  * **Note**: Ok. But like I wrote above.
* job. I just tweeted about a kid who he said every line of code he’s ever written, CS student at Waterloo, has been on Replit. He just interned at Apple, and presumably he used Replit as well there. So
  * **Note**: Bullshit. No. Apple would NEVER allow this. EVER.
* Everyone wants to move faster, and so Replit will help you move faster in the same way Figma helps you move faster. Being able to pass a link around, the link has your complete application and just making code more accessible in the same way that Figma made designs more accessible. That’s
  * **Note**: Bold comparison
* think we’re going to build it, and part of the reason I think we’re going to build it is because people have been saying we’re going to get killed by Microsoft or Github or whatever for a long time, and it hasn’t happened. We still have the lead, we’re still the top multiplayer programming environment, we’re still the fastest thing to get started, and so we’re going to continue creating that lead.
  * **Note**: But you don't have unlimited capital or cachet. You may have the lead but there are bigger and smaller cos encroaching on that moat you're building around Replit with boats and cannons.
* The idea that I can pass you a link and we’re both looking at the same thing, that is the fundamental of collaboration. So it was immediately obvious for us the moment we added saving of projects and the ability to pass around these links — the way people used to collaborate before we added multiplayer coding is that I’ll get a link, I’ll fork that, and I’ll change something, I’ll send you a link, and people will fork things thousands of times and just go back and forth between each other. Collaboration was an emergent property of the architecture of the system just by being in on the web and then collaborative coding — Google Docs sort of popularized this idea of being in real time together, and it was an obvious extension of being able to pass a URL and being able to have access to the same object and the same thing that you’re viewing the same document.
  * **Note**: Glitch, remember that?
* We think there’s this potential hybrid system somewhere between real time and between Git that exists where you could checkout single files, or you could imagine this thing that I like to call the multiverse of a code project where you have a single code project instance but every edition is sort of a mini-fork of the project and then you can transparently go between forks or go back to master and having all that kind of resolved in real time. There’s
* Is that where you see a real moat emerging for Replit, is in some of this collaboration infrastructure? Let me back up a little bit because this is one of the things I really want to press you on. The natural response, and I think programmers are notorious for this because they’re like, “Oh, I could have done that in a weekend or that’s a weekend project or XYZ, what’s the real differentiation here?” There’s levels of differentiation that you could apply to a company like Replit. There’s the technical capability of running an IDE in a browser. There’s this ability to have this fully integrated, not just run it but actually deploy it — all tied together that we talked about a little bit ago. There’s this collaborative bit which is solving some real problems, particularly because a program to your point can be in different states, not just a text document where it’s just always a text document, but there actually has to be the editing state and also the compile. Well, you do compile languages, but the actual running state is maybe the way to put it. There’s a community bit where you can post stuff and you have your store, for lack of a better word — I’m sorry, I’m using the wrong term — you have the community all around it. Then you have this almost just mind share, everyone knows what Replit is, and you have a much more efficient go-to-market and customer acquisition tool because you’re just the biggest player in the game. Where do you think about those? Where’s the ranking? Is there an aspect where what mattered for a differentiator to get you off the ground six years ago was one thing, and that shifted over time? Is that a correct articulation of what’s happened and where do you see it in the long run? What makes Replit a defensible company with a moat a decade from now? AM: Yeah, great questions. I will say that things sort of changed since the initial kind of launch of the product. The way people viewed us is sort of this playground that is very easy to get started with, but there was a lot of low commitment users. It’s easier than starting my interpreter locally. Right. You didn’t even used to need an account, you could just go to the site and just start typing. AM: Yeah, exactly. (laughing)Crypto fixed that.
* AM: (laughing) And you want to have a defensible business. Over time we’re focused on the users that are trying to do more with the site. You mentioned serving programmers is kind of difficult, I’ve done that all my career so I know their psychology, but some people push back on change in a very aggressive manner. “Replit is selling out”, changing whatever you want to call it, but really what we’re trying to do is trying to solve the entire lifecycle problem and by virtue of doing that, people are much more investeded in the product.
