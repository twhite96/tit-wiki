## Highlights
- 1/ Common web development terms in 280 characters.
  Let me know what terms you'd like me to explain and I'll add more to this thread over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1506287007307341834))
- 2/ Compilation
  You write code in developer-friendly languages (TypeScript, modern JavaScript, JSX).
  Then, compilation transforms it back to standard JavaScript so the browser can understand it.

- 3/ Minifying
  You write code optimized for human readability. But things like comments aren't necessary for the code to run.
  Minification removes unnecessary code formatting / comments, without changing the code‚Äôs functionality, to decrease the file size.

- 4/ Bundling
  You write code as modules and components, then import / export reusable pieces of code, creating a web of dependencies.
  Bundling resolves this web to combine files, reducing the number of network requests needed when visiting a page.

- 5/ Code Splitting
  You write code for many URLs in your application. However, you only want to load the code needed for that URL.
  Code splitting separates your application code into smaller chunks for each URL, improving initial load time by only loading the code for that page.

- 6/ Client-Side Rendering
  The browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server, along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. Then, the user's device creates the rendered UI using JavaScript.

- 7/ Prerendering
  The server generates HTML in advance, instead of having the rendered UI created by JavaScript on the user's device. 
  HTML provides a fast non-interactive page, and then hydration makes components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button).

- Category: #tweets
- URL: https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110888321978368

## Highlights
- the adaptation to a world deeply integrated with AI tools is probably going to happen pretty quickly; the benefits (and fun!) have too much upside. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110888321978368))
- these tools will help us be more productive (can't wait to spend less time doing email!), healthier (AI medical advisors for people who can‚Äôt afford care), smarter (students using ChatGPT to learn), and more entertained (AI memes lolol). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110889508978688))
- a transition like this is mostly good, and can happen somewhat fast‚Äîthe transition from the pre-smartphone world to post-smartphone world is a recent example.
  but it‚Äôll be tempting to go super quickly, which is frightening‚Äîsociety needs time to adapt to something so big. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110890800824320))
- there will be more challenges like bias (we don‚Äôt want ChatGPT to be pro or against any politics by default, but if you want either then it should be for you; working on this now) and people coming away unsettled from talking to a chatbot, even if they know what‚Äôs really going on ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110892059099138))
- we think showing these tools to the world early, while still somewhat broken, is critical if we are going to have sufficient input and repeated efforts to get it right. the level of individual empowerment coming is wonderful, but not without serious challenges. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110893388693504))
- we also need enough time for our institutions to figure out what to do. regulation will be critical and will take time to figure out; although current-generation AI tools aren‚Äôt very scary, i think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110894688931840))
- having time to understand what‚Äôs happening, how people want to use these tools, and how society can co-evolve is critical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110896165326848))

# Tweets From David K.

- Category: #tweets
- URL: https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano

## Highlights
- Async/await is *too* convenient sometimes.
  One of the most common mistakes I've seen is missing try/catch blocks for handling errors.
  Assume every awaited statement can reject ‚ö†Ô∏è
  Try to catch this in code reviews.
