# Thoughts

I'm trying to think about what it means to [[Making Content for Yourself]]. A lot of times I get stuck thinking about the *what* to write and for *whom*. This is detrimental to the writing process itself; see [Andy Matushak's thoughts on writing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J&stackedNotes=z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8) and [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C).

When you don't have much of an audience does it matter who you write for?

What are these notes, exactly? I am currently reading [[Messy Thought, Neat Thought]] by May-Li Khoe and I am really trying to process modes of thinking, how to take notes, and understanding how [[Spaced Repetition Memory Systems Make Memory a Choice|spaced repetition can help me better memorize and comprehend the things I read and consume]].

 [[Making Content for Yourself|Jeff Perry makes a really compelling case for just writing regardless of audience]]. To bring this back around to spaced repetition and memory; I think I just want to learn better in order to process my thinking and level up my writing. Just writing this note, I've hit the delete button several times because I don't believe my thoughts are coherent enough and I don't quite understand the material I've read and how to apply that to my writing and these notes.
