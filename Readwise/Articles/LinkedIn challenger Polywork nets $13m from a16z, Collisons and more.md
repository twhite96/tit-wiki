## Highlights
* “Our pitch to investors was basically reframing what LinkedIn is trying to do. Like, how useful is a CV with a list of skills, really? To me it’s not about what skills you have, but about what you actually do with them. “When you’re signalling to people who you are, the primary forms of identification are job title, or where you went to school — which are both pretty terrible proxies for who you actually are and what you care about.”
  * **Note**: This is an interesting statement. I'm curious about the longevity of such a model which is probably more popular with Millennials and younger.
