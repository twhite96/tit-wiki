## Highlights
- Likewise, every time you chain array method calls, lodash methods, observables (RxJS, etc…) you’re composing functions. If you’re chaining, you’re composing. If you’re passing return values into other functions, you’re composing. If you call two methods in a sequence, you’re composing using this as input data.
- The process of software development is breaking down large problems into smaller problems, building components that solve those smaller problems, then composing those components together to form a complete application.
- In 2013, a jury found Toyota’s software development team guilty of “reckless disregard” after an accident investigation revealed spaghetti code with 10,000 global variables.
