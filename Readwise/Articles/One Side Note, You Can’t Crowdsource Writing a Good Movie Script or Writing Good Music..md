## Highlights
- One side note, you can’t crowdsource writing a good movie script or writing good music. To the extent products rely on creative insight or inspiration (video game dev for example) you can’t focus group your way to success. Once the core product is created you can use user feedback. But too often focus groups happen too early in the product development process and dilute the direction and potential impact.
