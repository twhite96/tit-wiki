## Highlights
* The whole situation has been made unnecessarily messy by the media painting this as a fight between two people. I don’t remember the same amount of vitriol being thrown at Neil Young or Joni Mitchell when they pulled their music from the streaming service. But whenever a Black woman takes a stand, it’s always the end of the world. We don’t get to have opinions on things, because the world says Black women are too emotional and irrational to have clear thoughts on what’s right and wrong. Of course, we’re usually the only ones thinking clearly, because we don’t have the luxury of flying off the handle every time we’re offended, but again, don’t let the truth get in the way.
