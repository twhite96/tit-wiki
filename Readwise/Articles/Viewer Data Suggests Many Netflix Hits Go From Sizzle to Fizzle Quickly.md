## Highlights
* The discrepancy between Whip Media and TVision’s data on “Squid Game” viewership in the two months following debut may be explained simply by such: TVision’s data is U.S. only, while the TV Time data is global. The TV Time numbers may be reflecting many non-U.S. consumers watching the Korean-language “Squid Game” in the days following its debut, while TVision’s numbers could reflect how many in the U.S. didn’t catch "Squid Game” fever until month two of its release.
* A caveat to the TVision data is that the analytics firm did not capture viewing of six of the titles in the graphic above (titles with an asterisk) until a few days after they debuted. This likely is in part due to the panel size of TVision, but it still doesn’t seem to disqualify the assertion that top Netflix hits lose steam significantly after the first month of debut. If anything, not observing data within the first few days of debut would suggest that TVision is undercounting viewership of these top 2021 Netflix originals at some point during their first month of debut. And boosting the first month viewership totals of these programs would only further solidify the point that top Netflix originals suffer significant viewership drops in the period following their debut month.
