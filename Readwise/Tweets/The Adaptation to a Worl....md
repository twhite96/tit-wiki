## Highlights
- the adaptation to a world deeply integrated with AI tools is probably going to happen pretty quickly; the benefits (and fun!) have too much upside. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110888321978368))
- these tools will help us be more productive (can't wait to spend less time doing email!), healthier (AI medical advisors for people who can’t afford care), smarter (students using ChatGPT to learn), and more entertained (AI memes lolol).

- a transition like this is mostly good, and can happen somewhat fast—the transition from the pre-smartphone world to post-smartphone world is a recent example.
  but it’ll be tempting to go super quickly, which is frightening—society needs time to adapt to something so big. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110890800824320))
- there will be more challenges like bias (we don’t want ChatGPT to be pro or against any politics by default, but if you want either then it should be for you; working on this now) and people coming away unsettled from talking to a chatbot, even if they know what’s really going on ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110892059099138))
- we think showing these tools to the world early, while still somewhat broken, is critical if we are going to have sufficient input and repeated efforts to get it right. the level of individual empowerment coming is wonderful, but not without serious challenges.

- we also need enough time for our institutions to figure out what to do. regulation will be critical and will take time to figure out; although current-generation AI tools aren’t very scary, i think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones.

- having time to understand what’s happening, how people want to use these tools, and how society can co-evolve is critical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1627110896165326848))
