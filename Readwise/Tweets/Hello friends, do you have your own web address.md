## Highlights
* Hello friends, do you have your own web address? I know maybe you’re thinking, “I don’t need that!” or “that’s too much work!” but I promise, if you’ve got an instagram account, then you should definitely have a little place of your own. It’s important, and can be very fun. (If you’re worried that it’s too hard to set something up on your own site, a lot of tools are far easier these days! I made http://anil.fun on @Glitch in two minutes.)
